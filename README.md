# Register-Form-Front-End-Project

###### A small front end-React project that builds a website registration form with validations.



**This project demonstrated a generic registration form with front end validations that could be applied to many sorts of websites.**
<br />

*3 main reasons to why it's important to use front-end validations:*
- [x] *It is critical that we check user input to ensure that it fits our app standards.*
- [x] *The user receives imidiate feedback so the user gets the best user experience and app functionality.*
- [x] *Using front-end validations prevents excessive POST/PATCH requests from being made, resulting in a faster procedure with less processing because data is checked before it is transmitted to the server.*

**After a successful registration, the user can view the information that was entered and create another account.**
<br />

*This form can be added later to a website where the user can see its propfile information, and with minor adjustments, this form can be used to update user data.*
